                It's 11:47 PM. Dua Lipa's single drops at midnight across 47 countries. The marketing manager is frantically digging through Slack threads, searching for the approved cover art that was 'definitely sent somewhere.' Three time zones away, the Sydney team is waiting. The clock is ticking.

                <h3 className="case-study-detail">
                 The deeper I dug, the messier it got. Marketing managers were burning out from playing digital detective every day. <em>'I spend more time hunting files than creating campaigns,'</em> one told me. Label executives were frustrated watching million-dollar launches get delayed over missing assets. The real problem wasn't the toolâ€”it was the chaos everyone had learned to accept as normal.

                Staring at dozens of sticky notes, the pattern became impossible to ignore. Every team, every region, every roleâ€”they all had the same breaking point: the moment a file goes missing and everything stops. We weren't just mapping user needs, we were mapping the anatomy of chaos. The breakthrough: what if we could eliminate that moment entirely?
